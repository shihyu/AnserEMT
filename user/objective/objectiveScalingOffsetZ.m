function [Bdiff]=objectiveScalingOffsetZ(parameters, calFieldCoil, coilIndex, sys)
% objectiveScalingOffsetZ.m
% Objective function for the calibration procedure.
% The function calculates the field error between the sensed flux and modelled flux, at a set of known predefined testpoints.
% Calculation are performed on each emitter coil individually as indicated by 'coilIndex'.

% parameters   = The vector of variable parameters [zoffset, Bscale] for the LMA algorithm.
    % zoffset indicates the most recent estimation of the error between ideal and actual sensor position
    % Bscale is the most recent estimation of the calibration scaling factor required to fit the realworld magnetic field with the model.
% calFieldCoil = The vector of magnetic field strengths of size 'numCalPoints'. Each strength value in this vector represents the field strength at an individual testpoint due to a single emitter coil of index 'coilIndex'.
% coilIndex    = The index of the coil currently being analysed
% sys          = The system object

% Bdiff        = A vector of length 'numCalPoints'. Contains the magnetic field strength differences in the z-direction between the model and sensed fields, due to a single emitter coil 'coilIndex'.
